#### About me

My name is Vladislav, i live In Minsk, i am 23 years old. 7 months ago I started doing the course of front-end dev, besides i am doing the English course individually. I think that English will help me to succeed in this profession, and this language is international, because it is useful everywhere. I entered this sphere because i was always interested in the inner aspect of all webs, apps, games. And 7 month ago i decided to make this interest my profession.
